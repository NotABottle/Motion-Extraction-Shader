### Description
In essence it highlights objects that are in motion and creates after images of them which are then rendered on top of one another to create a trail effect.

### Installation
To use, simply open your Unity 6 project then download and run the .unitypackage. This will install the package into your project. Once you have done this, create a second camera, create a render target, and attach the script to the camera. Finally, create a quad and apply the provided material to the quad, changing any settings as necessary.
